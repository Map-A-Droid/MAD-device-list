## Runs w/o battery
Determines if the phone runs without a battery.
Possible entries:

* no -
* yes/usb - runs from usb, if you remove the battery
* yes/soldering - runs under special circumstances you are willing to describe

If you put in yes/soldering please leave a note with explanation or contact for questions.

**DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME** (unless you know what you're doing)
If you burn down your house, you'll get a special role in discord. But that's all.
